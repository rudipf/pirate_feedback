<p>=Personal list of contacts=</p>
<p></p>
<p>In order to find other members more quickly, you can add them to your personal list of contacts. On the profile page of the respective member you will find a link for doing so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you publish a contact, others can see this member as listed on your list of contacts. Published contacts are on this page marked with a green icon, hidden contacts with a grey icon. A click on the icon toggles the state.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contacts can be deleted again by clicking on the red icon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>**Important:** For improved ease-of-use your list of contacts will be shown to you when you delegate. In order to delegate to a member, you must first add him or her to your contacts. Removing a contact does not revoke the delegation, though.</p>
